Group Project Title for Team 2: Residential Maintenance Management System

Team Members: Tristan Kras, Quin Perkins, Bethlehem Tewodros, Sandip Poudel

Project Description:
The Java-based Residential Maintenance Management System streamlines communication between building managers and tenants through a ticketing platform. It centralizes apartment maintenance operations, making it easier for tenants and property management teams to coordinate. Tenants can submit maintenance requests by describing the issue, selecting a category, and attaching photos if needed. Each request generates a unique ticket with a timestamp and priority level.

Problem Description:
This system eliminates the need for calls, voicemails, emails, and texts, reducing delays in resolving maintenance issues. Apartment maintenance is a daily challenge for property managers and owners, particularly in residential complexes. The system helps prevent missed or overlooked requests, improving efficiency and the quality of life for both tenants and property managers. It can also be applied to rental properties, Airbnbs, hotels, and businesses with multiple sites to manage incoming maintenance requests more effectively.
